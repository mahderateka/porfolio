With over 7 years of experience in data analytics, I bring a unique blend of expertise and passion to the field. My professional journey began with a fellowship at the CDC, where I utilized Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data to predict the duration of Hepatitis C infection. After ~3 years in public service, I transitioned into the Real-world Evidence (RWE) space, where I focus on leveraging Electronic Health Records (EHR), claims, and registry datasets to conduct RWE studies across various therapeutic areas such as Virology, Oncology, Respiratory, and Neurology.

I take pride in infusing narratives into my analyses, making complex information accessible and engaging. This storytelling approach is more than a professional skill; it's a reflection of my personality and genuine passion for the work I do. Outside of work, I enjoy traveling, spending time with my wonderful husband and dog, and hosting my family and friends.
